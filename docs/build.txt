Building requres python3, cxfreeze ( a python script to generate a
.exe launcher, unfortunately, this is not currently optional, the
Makefile needs rewriting to allow this. ), SDL2, SDL2_image, freetype,
and my FIAL library.  The only current toolchain supported is mingw on
windows.

Well, essentially the best way to do this, is to copy the Makefile in
the ROOT/build directory out into its own directory, and then filling
in the directories at the top.  The destination directory must also be
directly off of the ROOT directory.  If you don't copy, you run the
risk of your makefile getting clobbered when you deal with git, since
the makefile is in the repository.  So, from the root directory:

cp -r build your_build_dir

Then, you have to configure your makefile. The LIBNAME_CFLAGS are
essentially to hold the include director flags[gcc -I], while the
LDFLAGS are to hold the library directory flags, [gcc -L].  For SDL
and freetype, it is simplest to just copy in the [LIB]-config script
from those libraries into your build folder.

Then, the next step is to copy all the dll's and required .exe's into
that build directory, which is where the "make package" command is
going to expect them.

Currently needed:

(*) the dejavu font "DejaVuSansMono.ttf"
(*) 7z.exe and 7z.dll, from 7-zip.
(*) SDL2, and SDL2_image, along with its assortment of DLL's.
(*) freetype

Then, to build, you simply run:

make
make package

And the results will be in your_build_dir/package.
