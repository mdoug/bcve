Building requres python3, cxfreeze ( a python script to generate a
.exe launcher, unfortunately, this is not currently optional, the
Makefile needs rewriting to allow this. ), SDL2, SDL2_image, freetype,
and my FIAL library.  The only current toolchain supported is mingw on
windows.

Well, essentially the best way to do this, is to copy the Makefile in
the ROOT/build directory out into its own directory, and then filling
in the directories at the top.  The LIBNAME_CFLAGS are essentially to
hold the include director flags[gcc -I], while the LDFLAGS are to hold
the library directory flags, [gcc -L].  For SDL and freetype, it is
simplest to just copy in the [LIB]-config script from those libraries
into your build folder.

Then, the next step is to copy all the dll's and required .exe's into
that build directory, which is where the "make package" command is
going to expect them.  Then, to build, you simply run:

make
make package

And the results will be in your_build_dir/package.
