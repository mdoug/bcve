Hi, thanks for using the Best. Comic. Viewer. Ever.  Just double click
on launcher.exe, choose your .cbz or .cbr file by clicking on "open file",
and then click "launch bcve".

You can adjust options on the left hand side of the launcher window.
Also, you can select a directory that is filled with .JPG files, and
BCVE will load the files in them as if they were archived.

Please note that BCVE is not currently aple to gracefully handle large
comic books, so please just use it on single issues for now.  If you
want to read a large book with bcve, currently the only option is to
open it with an archive viewer (.cbr and .cbz files are really .rar
and .zip files, respectively), and to unzip some of the files into a
directory.  Then this directory can be viewed with bcve as if it were
any other folder of .JPG files.
