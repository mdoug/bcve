This is the Best. Comics. Viewer. Ever.  It is the first application
written using my embedded language FIAL, and in some ways, providing a
use case for that language is this applications real primary purpose.
However, that being said, its not called the bcve for nothing!  It's
called that for one reason, comic book fans -- because I figured, hey,
why not.

The application will use opengl for rendering, utilizing SDL for user
interface stuff, and the event loop, and I think threads as well --
basically, if it's available for SDL, I'll use SDL, and that will ease
any ports later.  Hopefully.

So the basic idea is this -- the images of the comic pages will be
laid out sequentially, and the user can scroll through them left to
right or right to left or whatever, and eventually rotate them (i.e.,
not implemented yet).  That is the basic idea.

Obviously, with opengl, comes the ability to use the end users video
hardware to seemlessly utilize filters.  Also, easy "screen shot"
stuff using render to texture, for the purpose of creating wallpapers.

The user interface will basically suck.  But it will be awesome for
me, and that's all that counts.  I'm thinking more or less a basic
menu, with more advance functionality available through a console of
sorts.  Not entirely sure.  hrmmm.

As it stands now, there is no menu in bcve, but it does have a
launcher, that can be used open files with bcve for viewing.
