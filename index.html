<a name="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome!</h3>

<p>Hi!  This is the project page for a comic book reader.  If you were looking for something else, then you are in the wrong place.  Like, exactly wrong.  </p>

<p>This reader utilizes openGL to utilize hardware acceleration for the reading of comic books.  This currently does not manifest itself in many ways, only in the ability to pan and zoom.  Of course, rotations are planned, as well as filters, and render to texture abilities, to make some wicked wallpapers.  Stay Tuned!</p>

<h3>
<a name="comics" class="anchor" href="#comics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Comics!</h3>

<p>Of course, a comic book reader, even a really awesome one, is only useful because there are so many great comic books out there.  And there are great comics, because there are great artists, and great writers, and it turns out when you combine good art and good stories, you get good comics.  And then, some companies sell them in DRM free formats that open source projects can display them in, and there is much rejoicing.  </p>

<p>This list is not meant to be exhaustive:</p>

<p><a href="http://imagecomics.com/">Image</a> -- .cbz, .cbr</p>

<p>Well it's a good thing this wasn't meant to be exhaustive.  Feel free to add to the wiki any other comic publishers, and I'll move them up here!</p>

<p>Image is awesome though, check them out!  Plus, they're from Berkeley.  Go Bears!</p>

<a name="made-of-fial" class="anchor" href="#made-of-fial"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Made of FIAL!</h3>

<p>This app was made primarily to give me a use case for a scripting language.  A Fine, Iterative, Algorithmic, Language, that I call FIAL.  As I am using it, I am finding things that have to change in the language, and as such will require change in bcve, merely to work properly.  This is somewhat unfortunate for bcve, but very fortunate for FIAL, and even more fortunate for projects that I create using FIAL afterwards.  </p>

<p>I once read somewhere that the great question isn't why we die, it is why we are born in the first place.  And so, if you are wondering why bcve does something that seems wrong, consider that it is largely created in an undocumented scripting language, using deprecated features, that are deprecated according to a deprecation schedule that only exists as vague notions in my mind.  And then marvel that it even works at all!</p>

<p>But, more seriously, this will result in uneven development, but that is not to say that there are no benefits from having a close tie the scripting language it is being developed in.  Hopefully, FIAL well eventually hit some points where its api's and language are relatively stable -- say when I am writing the compiler for it -- and at those points bcve can really spurt.  But time will tell.</p>
